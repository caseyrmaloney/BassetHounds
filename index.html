                    Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds.
                     In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes. Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years,
                     and since then dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds,
                      with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology, which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour.
                      Their behavioural traits include guarding, herding, and hunting,retrieving, and scent detection.
                     Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, and aggression,which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. As a result, today dogs are the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world.

                    In an interview with the BBC’s Zane Rowe McCartney was talking about the sound of vinyl and confirmed the much rumoured dog theory. <i>“I think vinyl is the best. 
                     It just sounds good,” </i> he said. <i> “I asked my engineers why it sounds good and they explained that there are frequencies above and below that you can’t hear. We got into a rap with George Martin a long time ago. 
                     We’d talk for hours about these frequencies below the sub that you couldn’t really hear and the high frequencies that only dogs could hear. We put a sound on ‘Sgt Pepper’ that only dogs could hear. 
                    If you ever play ‘Sgt Pepper’ watch your dog”.</i>

                <p class="sec4-info"> 
                    The Basset Hound is a short-legged breed of dog in the hound family. 
                    The Basset is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare. Their sense of smell and ability to ground-scent is second only to the Bloodhound.
                    Basset Hounds are one of six recognized "basset"-type breeds in France. The name Basset is derived from the French word bas, meaning 'low', with the attenuating suffix -et—together meaning 'rather low'. 
                    Basset Hounds are usually bicolours or tricolours of standard hound coloration.
